In order to study the performances of these six sorting algorithms, I generated different size of arrays and compared the running speed of them (including the std::sort function in STL). Since it's a waste of time to wrote a comparison script written in C++, I chose node-gyp to build the sorting algorithm into a C++ addon of node, and then wrote some Javascript code to benchmark them. Small size of arrays were run for several times so that the result can be more accurate.

The limitation of runtime was set to 1s for all algorithms, so some meaningless and slow running were dropped (eg. large array size for bubble sort). Then I used MATLAB to plot two graphs, one of small test cases, and another of all cases.
